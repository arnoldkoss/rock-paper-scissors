## Design

- Colour Scheme

The game interface is designed using a harmonious blend of colors, with a dark gray background providing a sleek and modern backdrop. Crisp black text ensures clear and easy-to-read instructions and game updates. Additionally, green highlights signify the leading score, while red accents draw attention to the score that is lagging, creating a visually engaging and dynamic gaming experience.
